We estimate country-to-country migration flows at monthly granularity for 181 countries using privacy protected records from three billion Facebook users. This dataset contains the monthly estimates for each country pair from 2019 to 2022. We exclude very small countries and countries in which Facebook is banned or where other constraints restrict our estimation. To account for the fact that Facebook usage varies across countries, we weight our data to make it representative at the population level. After applying the weights, we add noise to our estimates using techniques from differential privacy.

We define migration as living in one country for the majority of a 12-month period before moving to another country for the majority of the following 12 months, matching the definition of migration recommended by the United Nations (https://unstats.un.org/unsd/publication/seriesm/seriesm_58rev1e.pdf). If individuals or families who leave a country and go from place to place for less than 12 months, they are not considered migrants to those countries and are only counted in the migration estimates when they remain in the destination for at least one year.

Several other prominent migration statistics exist from official sources, which may differ from Meta’s estimates significantly due to differences in definition.

(1) Migrant stocks - The United Nation estimates a global population of 281 million migrants in 2020 (https://publications.iom.int/books/world-migration-report-2022). This statistic is referring to the stock of migrants, which is the cumulative count of persons who are currently not in their country of birth, regardless of when they arrived. Meta’s estimates represent migrant flows, which are the number of people that moved between countries in a given year. For any given year, the total number of migrant stocks is likely much higher than the migrant flow, as this is the total number of migrants living in a country regardless of when they have arrived, whereas the flow – what Meta’s estimates capture –  counts the incremental number of people who have recently migrated.

(2) Border encounters - U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) publishes estimates on the number of migrants encountered at the border each month (https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/nationwide-encounters). Meta’s estimates and CBP’s differ in several ways — Meta has no information on citizenship and thus defines migrants' origin using the country in which they last resided for 12 months, whereas CBP uses the migrant's citizenship through the data collected at the time of border crossing. As a result of these differences, Meta’s estimates may look higher or lower for particular countries of origin if large numbers of migrants are waiting to enter the US from a nearby country for over a year. The figures presented by CBP also do not include many types of migration, such as students and people for work, which is present in Meta’s estimates. Due to these differences, Meta’s estimates of migrant flows may diverge from those reported by CBP.
